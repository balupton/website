                <p>It features such technologies as [url content="balcms" link="true"/] for the Content Management System, [url content="jquery-ajaxy" link="true"/] for the Web 2.0 Ajax Effects, [url content="jquery-sparkle" link="true"/] for the Web 2.0 Framework, and [url content="jquery-syntaxhighlighter" link="true"/] for the Syntax Highlighter.</p>
                <p>There are still a fair few quirks here and there, and a lot of improvements to be made: such as fixing it for internet explorer, a better user page, and better content - but alas, it is still ready for production use, so yay!</p>

It aims at solving complicated AJAX Paradigms by providing you with a easy managed solution to bind into page state (URL Hash) changes, AJAX form submits, and support AJAX links.</p> 
                <p>Anyone who has tried to do this themselves would no doubt have spent countless hours debugging tedious javascript ajax requests, trying to figure out how to get ajax pages bookmarkable and working with back and forward buttons, or even struggled to add javascript effects to help manage your pages. jQuery Ajaxy was developed to solve all these problems, as well as some you may have never encountered such as; How do I keep my page indexable by Search Engines while making it an Ajax Application, How do I keep my site accessible to those who have javascript disabled? How I ensure I send the correct page back to the browser?</p> 
                <p>All of those problems are extremely difficult to solve, which is why we've solved them for you.</p>

                    <li>It's unbelievably simple to upgrade your ordinary links and forms into Ajax requests by just adding a CSS classname.</li> 
                    <li>You already have automatic support for tracking state changes in your now web application so you don't have to worry about this at all - we do it for you. This allows it so the user can still use those back and forward buttons, or even send the page URL to a friend and see the same thing!</li> 
                    <li>You can even submit forms via Ajax with confidence, without having to do any extra server side code.</li> 
                    <li>You will also have the ability to control your web applications state manually through your code for advanced circumstances.</li> 
                    <li>You will still have support for classical anchors despite us using hashes for our web application states! This means you can still direct your users to particular content on a webpage using a link like: <code>my/web/page.html#the-content-to-scroll-to</code></li>
